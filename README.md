# Rumos Data Engineer Academy: MusicStreaming Projec

## Introduction
This repository countains parts of the project developed during RUMOS Data Engineer Academy course.

The project's objective is to design and implement a conceptual, logical, and physical architecture for a music streaming platform.

The initial task involved designing a relational database to meet all specified criteria, starting with the definition of an ER model. This database was then implemented in MS SQL Server.

To populate the database, data was imported from CSV files using Visual Studio with Integration Services (SSIS).

Subsequently, the database was migrated to a cloud environment (Azure SQL Database), along with the SSIS packages, which were transitioned to Azure Data Factory.
